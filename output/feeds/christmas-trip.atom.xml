everyday life of the average Finn. It's not obvious from the get-go, but
becoming mobile is very, very easy over here--provided you already have
the necessary devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to provide an example. The past two years I've visited, I had
my phone with me, but it was a very limited-use device, what with
exorbitant roaming charges, so I mostly kept it off, or in Wi-Fi-only
mode. This year, I decided to just bite the bullet and pick up a prepaid
SIM card and slot it in for the duration of my visit. I had a hard time
finding concrete information on how much a decently-priced data plan
would be, or what the limits or speed would be like, so I decided to
just play it by ear and figure it out when I got here. In the US,
picking up a prepaid plan is often a bit of a pain. I looked into AT&amp;amp;T's
prepaid plans a year or two ago and they were expensive and restrictive.
T-Mobile's aren't bad, but their coverage is spotty. Finding information
on anything else proved to be surprisingly difficult, and finding a
retailer to sell a prepaid SIM was a crap-shoot at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in Finland, we walked into an R-Kioski (roughly equivalent to a
7-11), asked what prepaid cards they had available and were handed a
list comparing five or six different brands and plan details. I wound up
paying 5 euros for a card pre-loaded with 6.60€. Calls are 0.06€ a
minute, texts are 0.06€ per, and data is 0.66€ per day for unlimited
usage. (These are all domestic rates. Calling and texting out of the
country is naturally quite a bit more expensive). Since, for the most
part, I use my phone as a pocket computer and don't do a whole lot of
texting or calling, this plan is fantastic for me. I also get consistent
4G speeds and a good signal everywhere (though I think that's more a
result of Finland's small size and flat geography). The best part? I can
share my phone's (unlimited!) data plan with anything via Wi-Fi. I'm
actually writing this post on my tablet using my phone's internet
connection. Give me a power outlet and I can keep this up from pretty
much anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just phone service. I keep running into little things that
are surprisingly complex and well-designed. Take, for example, this
video of me demonstrating how to recycle bottles in Finland:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="750" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFraSWjsDkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually place the bottle onto a treadmill that's capable of moving
the bottle back and forth as well as rotating it. It sucks up the
bottle, and a barcode scanner looks for the barcode. If it can't find
it, it starts rotating the bottle until it's successful. It's an
impressively-designed bit of machinery, and I am very jealous of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it's not so surprisingly that their designers and engineers
are inspired when they've got views like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Personal space is a very big deal over here.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like most stereotypes, there's nugget of truth to that--for example,
and I'm sure I've mentioned this before, the amount of automation in
everyday life is staggering. Recycling cans? There's a machine for that
in every store. Buying cigarettes at checkout? There's a machine for
that, no interaction with cashier necessary*. Waiting at the post
office? Take a number and watch the digital sign, no need to stand in
line, and no need to call out the number of whose turn it is. In fact,
there exists an entire hotel chain that has zero staff (save for
cleaning staff and centralized support staff, presumably).-- you check
in and out via website, and are given a keycode to allow entry. There's
not even a front desk. Even their public bathrooms seem to discourage
socializing, as most stalls have a sink, towel dispenser and trash can
inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prominent example however, is that most Finns aren't much
interested in small talk. I've been able to get through many a checkout
line with nothing more than "Hello" and "Thanks", and was just fine. On
the other hand, they're certainly not &lt;em&gt;allergic&lt;/em&gt; to a little polite
chit-chat. It just has to be relevant or interesting. Really, the
biggest stumbling block for a foreigner over here--especially a foreign
American--is one that I haven't really seen reflected in any sort of
stereotype. It is the fact that conversation in Finland is a serial
thing; one person talks, other people listen. You do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; interrupt
that person. Once they are done talking, there will be a contemplative
silence where everybody thinks about what was said. After that, another
person will begin speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;really really hard to respect&lt;/em&gt;. As a young, American male my
preferred mode of conversation is to interject with a relevant anecdote
or addition to whatever story a speaker is telling whenever possible. My
expectation is that the rest of the group will enjoy my addition or be
able to use to build upon. This is not the case with most Finns. Often,
you will completely derail their train of thought and, as a bonus, be
seen as very rude. Thus, the stereotype of the loud, rude American is
perpetuated, and everybody walks away angry or dissatisfied. Kaisa has
told me that for her, speaking to a group of Americans is incredibly
stressful, because the length of lulls in conversation where a new
speaker has an opportunity to take over are miniscule compared to in a
group of Finns (And then you've got those people who completely dominate
the conversation and allow zero dead air. I can't even imagine how
they'd deal with that...). I was once forced to experience
serial conversation this way when my internet connection began acting up
during a Skype call with Kaisa. We started getting massive delay between
speaking, and the other person hearing us (something like a 5 second
delay). As a result, we just started using radio etiquette: the other
person doesn't have clearance to talk until they hear you say "Over". It
doesn't sound like it, but when you can see the other person talking,
and they bring up a point where you can offer input, keeping your trap
shut and just &lt;em&gt;waiting&lt;/em&gt; is often much harder than it sounds. Kaisa, on
the other hand, was perfectly at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, don't stand too close to them at the bus stops. Remember,
&lt;a href="http://satwcomic.com/no-invitation" title="they all carry knives"&gt;they all carry
knives.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*No longer strictly true--you have to ask the cashier for the number of
the brand you'd like to buy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="america"></category><category term="communication"></category><category term="Finland"></category><category term="Foreign"></category><category term="quiet"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>The Rural Metropolis</title><link href="http://pingzing.github.io/the-rural-metropolis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-27T10:18:00+02:00</published><updated>2013-01-27T10:18:00+02:00</updated><author><name>travelneil</name></author><id>tag:pingzing.github.io,2013-01-27:/the-rural-metropolis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a harrowing 24-hour transcontinental journey and a week to

recover, I'm back stateside and in Camarillo. I'm drinking a can of root
beer, and marveling at the fact that, for some reason, such a delicious
beverage has avoided making its way overseas (or at least into Finland).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm going to introduce you to life in the Finnish city.
Specifically, life in Jyväskylä. Mostly because I have a ton of unused
pictures from the city, and I was finally able to get some good daytime
shots, and I want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranking as the 7th-largest municipality in Finland by population,
Jyväskylä is a modestly large city with over 130,000 residents. I spent
most of my time within a few blocks of the city center which is home to
a series of pedestrian-only streets and a number of shops. Walking (or
biking) from the apartment to the city center was a lesson in cultural&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0712.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Parking:
a valuable
commodity." src="{filename}images/100_0712_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Parking: a valuable commodity.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;differences. The streets, while straight, were difficult to navigate by
car but lent themselves very naturally to somebody on foot or on a bike.
Walking down any street within 5 blocks of the city center, you're
surrounded by 4-5 story tall buildings, all of which have their first
story given over entirely to businesses and shops. It's a marked
difference from here in the U.S., where cars are a given and nobody
walks anywhere. In the span a little over half a mile, I'd walk past
small electronics stores, realtors offices, specialty food shops, little
restaurants, pubs, bike stores, and all kinds of other little things I
didn't take the time to recognize. And that's just the obvious,
well-indicated stuff. There are all kinds of other little things hidden
away behind a door, or on the second story that are harder to see. Dusty
classrooms where music is taught, Chinese buffets that couldn't land a
coveted first-story lease, tiny game development studios. I think that I
could walk three square blocks of that city every day for a year and
still not discover everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other curious thing is the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; everywhere. Think of the average
street in an American town around, say lunchtime, or rush hour when
people are going home. Now, imagine that every car is carrying anywhere
from 1 to 5 people. Now, take all those people out of their cars, and
put them on sidewalks, on foot or on bicycles. What you've got now is
the average Jyväskylä sidewalk. It's a strangely reassuring phenomenon.
Even though I'm in a foreign country, seeing people walking about doing
normal, everyday things is very comforting. It's like this all
throughout the day, from early morning to late at night. People go to
work in the morning, or come home from a night on the town with friends
at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0722.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pictured:
dense
metropolis." src="{filename}images/100_0722_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Pictured: dense metropolis.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not to say that there are people everywhere. Nor are there
buildings everywhere. If one day, the Finns decided to pack up, leave
their cities and stop cultivating the natural environment, it's
estimated that nature would reclaim the cities in as little as fifty
years. The church pictured to the left was right across the street from
the apartment I stayed in, which was only a few blocks away from the
city center. The Finns have to actively fight nature to carve out new
city blocks, and the city itself was surrounded by no less than three
lakes. Possibly more!&lt;/p&gt;

build an entire post around, but are still tangentially related to the

I am now back in Jyväskylä and have found some time to recount an
adventure I had a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when I mentioned filleted fish two posts ago? Well, when I was
visiting Kaisa's parents in Timola, I learned &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how said fish
were acquired. But first, a prelude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Christmas, I received a Finnish Survival Kit from Kaisa's family.
It consisted of a large can of beer, three small bottles of liquor, a
hunting knife, an ice-fishing rod and a pair of what I dubbed "miserable
ice-fisherman's gloves". I called them that because they brought to mind
an image of a cold-looking person perched in a camp chair staring
sleepily at a hole in the ice with those gloves on their hands. They
looked a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/123492_1_3_452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brr." src="{filename}images/123492_1_3_452_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Brr.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't mind the floral print. That was the best picture I could find on
short notice. I assure that mine were &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; manlier, if less stylish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to learn just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; miserable said ice-fisherman would be
under normal circumstances. I joined Kaisa, her father and her neighbor
(and her neighbor's dog Iita) as they went to retrieve whatever their
nets had caught in the past several days under the ice. Now, I'd like to
ask you to keep in mind that what I'm about to describe could be
accurately called the easier method of ice-fishing. The "hard" method
involves setting up a camp chair and perching over a hole in the ice for
hours and dangling a lure into the water. Nevertheless, this method
required a small car trunk full of gear to retrieve fish from a pair of
nets. The list of gear included, but was not limited to: a heavy iron
spear-like device to jab holes in the ice, a small tin can on legs and
enough firewood to keep it burning for about twenty minutes, lighter
fluid to light said fire, a big garbage bag to carry the catch, a roll
of twine to pull the net back under the ice once the fish have been
removed from it, a variant on the piikki I mentioned in the other fish
post and a dog. The dog, while optional, is highly recommended because
dogs are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once everything has been loaded and transported, you arrive at the
lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_06561.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="I'm
trying to keep every part of my body as close to me as
possible." src="{filename}images/100_06561_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;If you look closely, you can see a van parked on the ice in the  background. Some people take their ice fishing seriously. That or they  wanted easy access to a heater.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things comes to mind the first time you see a lake completely
frozen over, in roughly the following order: "Wow, will that really hold
my weight?", followed by "Wow, it is really &lt;em&gt;flat&lt;/em&gt; out here!" followed
shortly by "Oh my god, that means no windbreak and now my fingers are
useless, icy sausages." It is &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;. When we went out onto the ice, it
was -15c (5f) and the windchill made it feel like -100. I was just
wearing woolen mittens because they'd served me well so far, but those
weren't nearly enough for my poor Californian digits. Luckily, someone
had forseen this eventuality, and included in the kit of things was a
pair of thick mitten "shells" that go down to the wrist and slide over
other sets of gloves to windproof them. The downside is that they reduce
your capability to manipulate things to that of a particularly
nearsighted crab's. I struggled to adjust my zipper, or my hat, or just
abut anything really, but at least I could feel my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holes in the ice are marked with highly visible orange poles, and
small evergreen branches. They're created in pairs, and the net is
strung under the ice from one hole to the other, and then hangs down
like a curtain, ensnaring any fish that swim into it. The procedure for
retrieving the fish is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, find a hole. It's covered by a piece of thick styrofoam which
prevents the hole from completely refreezing. A pair of long branches
secure one end of the net. The branches are removed, and the net is
untied from the branch, but not allowed to slip into the water. At some
point, the heavy iron spear-thing is used to break through the ice.
Check for frostbite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, move to the other hole. Place tin can on the ice, fill with
firewood and light. Then, repeat the process from the first hole. Then,
reel in the net, inch by cold, wet inch. If there are any fish, rejoice,
spoils are yours. Check for frostbite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0659.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pictured:
rejoicing." src="{filename}images/100_0659_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Pictured: rejoicing.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in that picture above, Raimo's (Kaisa's neighbor) hands are
bare. He's reaching into the water to better handle the fish and the
net. I have no idea how they weren't literally frozen solid. I watched
some of drops of water on the net freeze before they had a chance to
fall. Finns are hardcore, man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, run the net back under the ice, then cover up both holes. Throw
the fish into the garbage bag (or whatever you have, I suppose. We had a
garbage bag). Scatter the ashes from the can-fire and cool it with
freezing lakewater. Return home with a bounty of fresh fish ready for
cooking. Check again for frostbite, just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0661.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The
blind lead the blind as I teach Itta the finer points of
fishing." src="{filename}images/100_0661_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;The blind lead the blind as I teach Itta the finer points of  fishing.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the expedition I took part in, we caught three fish with two nets
and successfully avoided frostbite. We returned home and were rewarded
for braving the freezing wilds* by having fresh fish for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0665.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pictured: serious
frostbite." src="{filename}images/100_0665_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Pictured: serious frostbite.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw the above phenomenon on our way back to the car, and Kaisa
thought it'd make a pretty cool picture. I agreed, and now you can enjoy
the ain't-it-cool factor as well. Also, credit for all photos goes to
Kaisa. I was too scared to take my fingers out of my lobster-claws to
manipulate the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

for "densely populated". Anywhere in the U.S., this would easily qualify
as a rural neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing for New Year's here involves buying three things: fireworks
and alcohol and lots of food. On the morning of New Year's Eve, I went
with Kaisa's family into the town of Varkaus, and we picked up all
three. By far the most interesting was the fireworks: the fireworks
stand we chose to buy from was inside a Toyota dealership, and manned by
a pair of enthusiastic young men. When I asked &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was in a Toyota
dealership, it was explained to me that the fireworks booths are always
located somewhere with sufficient open space and incentive to host them.
This year, one such location happened to be the Toyota dealership.
Fireworks available ranged from €1.50 Thunder Kings to a €99.50 Army
Box.  We left the dealership with two bags stuffed full of miscellaneous
fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the fireworks, it was time to stock up on drinks. Any drink
greater than 44 proof (22% alcohol by volume) can only be sold by the
publicly-owned Alko shops. There, Kaisa's father picked up a variety of
things, and Kaisa and I bought a bottle of Salmiakki vodka, Minttu
peppermint vodka, and some Conways Country Irish Cream. The Salmiakki is
by far the most interesting of the bunch. Salmiakki is a Finnish candy
that tastes like salty black licorice. As an alcoholic beverage it's
certainly...strange, but I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then was a trip to the grocery store, and then home. A few hours later,
we went to visit Raimo and Marjo, Kaisa's parents' neighbors, for the
night. As soon as we arrived, it was decided that we would set off some
preliminary fireworks, eat some food, then move on to the main event. As
I arrived at the firing ground, Kaisa's father Reima brandished what
looked like a large coffee can at me and explained that I after I lit
the fuse, I would have 5 seconds to run 50 meters (150 feet) to safety.
He also explained that Jamaican gold medalist Usain Bolt can only run
100 meters in 9 seconds--in short, what he'd asked of me was impossible.
I grinned and said that I knew and asked if we were ready. He nodded, so
I flipped down my safety glasses, knelt down, lit the fuse and ran. My
hat flew off, but true to my agreement with Reima, I kept running. I'd
made it maybe 15 meters before the fireworks began exploding. I judged
that I was far enough and turned to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/fireworks2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="fireworks2" src="{filename}images/fireworks2_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;And I found this!&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more of this, we returned indoors to eat. Upon entering, I
sat down at the table to a sort of after-dinner meal, and was informed
that Raimo had prepared the glass in front of me. I eyed it skeptically
before shrugging and taking a swig. I looked up to find the entire table
staring expectantly. I grinned and exclaimed "Ah! Salmiakki! On hyvää!"
("It's good!") to the apparent delight of everybody at the table. Over
the course of dinner, Raimo held his glass up to me with a cheerful
"Kippis!" ("Cheers!") no less than four times. After dinner was
complete, we returned outdoors to continue our explosive revelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite speaking scarcely a word of Finnish, I made fast friends of
Raimo's 7-year-old grandson after I allowed him to teach me how to light
the fireworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/fireworks1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="fireworks1" src="{filename}images/fireworks1_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;I greatly enjoyed my lessons in pyromania.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wasn't the only one setting off dangerous explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/fireworks4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="fireworks4" src="{filename}images/fireworks4_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Kaisa got involved too!&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exhausting our store of fireworks, we retreated inside Raimo's
&lt;em&gt;kota&lt;/em&gt; (a little hut with a fire pit in the center and seating around
the outside) and began trying to see our futures in melted tin
(something I &lt;a href="http://travelneil.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/and-a-happy-new-year/"&gt;alluded
to&lt;/a&gt; in
a post last year). We had forgotten to pick any up tin horseshoes at the
store earlier in the day, but Raimo's grandson was there to save us. He
had a little bag of tin horseshoes, and we wasted no time melting those
over the &lt;em&gt;kota&lt;/em&gt;'s fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/kota1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="kota1" src="{filename}images/kota1_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Raimo's grandson pulling his flash-solidified tin from the bucket of  water.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tin is melted over a fire, and then once liquefied, it's poured into
a bucket of water. After being given a moment to cool, it's pulled
out...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/kota3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="My tin.
DE
CLAWWWW" src="{filename}images/kota3_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;My tin. DE CLAWWWW&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and the shapes are interpreted according to some guidelines I'm not
entirely clear on.&lt;/p&gt;

with 410 grams each--just under 10 euros worth of fish per bag. It's
been salted, and one bag is currently sitting in the fridge waiting to
be prepared somehow. He also did it with a handmade knife, and an
interesting looking tool called a piikki (fish spike, or literally
"thorn") which apparently doubles as something you can jab into the ice
and pull yourself out with, should you fall in.&lt;/p&gt;

year where we drink ourselves into an eggnog-laden stupor before
frantically going out and buying a Christmas Tree at the last minute,
though it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that time of year. No, it's the time of year where I make
a trans-continental journey to the frozen north to spend Christmas in
the Land of Fin! This year, my trip is particularly insane, because I'm
coming off what was, without a doubt, the most difficult semester in my
college career so far. I'll take a just a moment to discourage you from
attempting to work part time, take (nearly) a full course-load &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
attempt to coordinate the logistics required for an international trip
simultaneously. With that disclaimer in place, join me while I spend the
rest of this post talking about some of the more interesting things I've
discovered as a result of being a stranger in a strange land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;\
 Time during Finnish winter is a strange thing. Briefly, for those
unaware, Finland is quite a bit further north than the rest of the
world. As a rule, during the wintertime, there's not a lot of sunlight
to go around. So while the days are not especially shorter, they are
quite a bit dimmer. The sun rises around 8AM, gives off weak dawnlight
even at its zenith, and we're back to full dark by about 4PM. To anybody
used to a more well-lit rhythm, this plays utter havoc with your body
clock. Normally, I can pretty reliably tell you what hour of the day it
is, but around here, all bets are off, especially after about 3 in the
afternoon. This has had an interesting effect on my mental state of
mind: I feel less rushed. When I don't have a good grasp on the time of
day, it's more difficult to set those mental deadlines for myself that
have me subconsciously worrying about time all the...well, time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm not mistaken, I've noticed it in the people here too. Despite the
fact that it's Christmastime, even in the densest of lines in the
crowdedest of shopping centers, there's none of the impatient,
almost-violent tension you feel in an American mall during Christmas. I
haven't been afraid that somebody will shank me for being in their way
while I've been here. Not once! This leads me to my next observation:
the "take a number, wait your turn" style of queuing is extremely
popular here. I can't say for sure if that's a Finnish thing, or a
European thing, but it's an interesting change from the "stand in line
and wait your turn" model that's so much more prevalent at home. It
seems to have gained popularity as a result of two things: the first
being the aforementioned patience (or at the least, lack of belligerent
resentment), and a more intense concentration of people in one place at
one time. Around here, the two most popular methods of transportation
are bicycles or a solid pair of of feet. As a result of that, most of
the shopping is done in the city center; a haphazard collection of shops
crammed into the first (and sometimes second) floors of any building
that will rent out a space in about 2 square city blocks. It's a little
bit like an outdoor mall crossed with a strip mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/crowdedshoping2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="{filename}images/crowdedshoping2_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Packed!&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is that if you want to get any shopping done, that's
where you go. In a city where everybody's on foot and shopping in the
same place, you have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people in the same place at the same
time. So what's a harried shopkeeper to do? Why, hand everybody a number
and tell them to shut up and wait their turn! And so I've seen this
system everywhere from department stores to the post office, and it's
often implemented with a surprising amount of care. There's an automated
ticket dispenser, and up above each clerk or teller, there's a display
that shows the number currently called, and somewhere more central, a
bigger sign that shows the most recent number called. Every time a new
number is "called", there's an audible beep of some kind, and life goes
on. There's no need for a clerk to ever shout themselves hoarse.\
 Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space&lt;/em&gt;\
 European countries, and Finland in particular suffer from a crippling
lack of a vital natural resource. Can you guess what it is? Not coal, or
gold, or gas, or oil, or even culture (though you can probably argue
otherwise from places), but &lt;em&gt;free space.&lt;/em&gt; Allow me to demonstrate why
that's the case here. Below is a picture of a Finnish roadside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/d15-finland-roads-0741.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="{filename}images/d15-finland-roads-0741_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Hidden just off-camera is a nothing but lakes. Build here, we dare  you.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See all the trees? That's what it's like everywhere. Where there aren't
trees, there are lakes. Where there aren't trees or lakes, you're in
luck! Except, oh wait, the entire country is on solid bedrock. Have fun
leveling out enough of it to make a solid building foundation. The good
news is that there aren't any mountains to speak of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, add all that together, and you've got a crippling space
shortage. As a result, every square meter is precious here. I admit that
this is a bit of a leap of logic to take, but it seems legitimate to me:
the result is that every living space is as bare as possible, and is
only filled in as necessary by the occupant. Bedroom closets are the
exception rather than the rule, and if they exist at all, they tend to
be the small, walk-in sort. More like a cozy kitchen pantry than
anything else. Bathrooms are especial victims of this particular design
philosophy; you won't find any cabinets or counters in the average
bathroom here. The only concession to space is often a single medicine
cabinet and maybe a small, wall-mounted closet. Anything else is usually
installed after-the-fact by the occupant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/bathroom1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image" src="{filename}images/bathroom1_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;A toilet paper holder and shelving in the apartment bathroom.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another result of this free space shortage is that everything is more
compact. Compounding this issue is the fact that heating is  a major
concern in winter. It's much, much cheaper to heat a shoebox than a
mansion. So spaces here, be they public or private, tend more to the
"shoebox" end of the scale. Though I can't say I mind; I'd much rather
be warm than have room to frolic in a banquet hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have I mentioned the cold yet? I don't believe I have, at least not
directly. It's been -15 degrees the past few days I've gone out. That's
about 3 degrees Fahrenheit. To put that in perspective, that's cold
enough that when I breathe in through my nose, I can feel my snot
freezing in real time. It is a &lt;em&gt;most unusual&lt;/em&gt; sensation. I recommend it
for anybody looking to experience chills and thrills.\
 Only joking. Just chills there.\
 Back to the original point, you can feel the design considerations for
heating everywhere you go. Everything is built down &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; up here. For
every two story building, it's a safe bet that there's at least a hidden
third story underground. Ceilings are low, storefronts front both the
street and an interior mall-like atrium. I walked into Jyväskylä's
public library the other day, noted the height of the ceilings and found
myself musing that the building must cost a fortune to heat in the
winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, it's cold, dark and quiet here. I can't really imagine a
better place to spend a month relaxing after a most hectic semester.
Everybody's gearing up (or should it be winding down?) for Christmas
here. With only three days to go (most celebrations happen on Christmas
Eve here), I'll be sure to report back sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, Merry Christmas ja Hyvää Joulua!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finland"></category><category term="Foreign"></category><category term="Images"></category><category term="International"></category><category term="Photos"></category><category term="Snow"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>And That's a Wrap</title><link href="http://pingzing.github.io/and-thats-a-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-26T12:52:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-02-26T12:52:00+02:00</updated><author><name>travelneil</name></author><id>tag:pingzing.github.io,2012-02-26:/and-thats-a-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, my intention was to make this post about a month ago.

&lt;p&gt;So, I've been back for two weeks now. I'd say that's long enough to have
re-acclimated to being in the US again. So with that in mind, today's
post is going to be a language lesson. Obviously, when visiting a
foreign country, unless we're talking about the U.K., Canada or
Australia, chances are good that English is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; going to be the native
tongue, and you will have to deal with another language. And when you're
exposed to a language for a long period of time--say, a month--then you
start noticing certain characteristics about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be frank: speaking Finnish is like pronouncing a series of
landmines. Your tongue is jumping all over from place to place, and the
oral gymnastics that are required to keep up are, quite frankly,
astounding. As a simple barometer of average word complexity, let's take
a look at average word length. In English, the average word is 5 letters
long. 5.10, if we're being specific. Finnish? It's harder to find solid
numbers, but 8 seems to be about on-target. Think about that for a
moment. "Catch" is a five-letter word. "Stricter" is eight letters long.
Imagine an entire sentence made of up Stricters, rather than Catches. 
Now, keep that in mind! That is an important piece of information! Got
it firmly nested into your noggin? Good. Now! Recall, if you will, that
averages don't account for outliers. Just because the average English
word is five letters long doesn't mean that we can't have ridiculousness
like "antidisestablishmentarianism". Since Finnish's average word length
has an extra three letters going for it...that means they have THAT MANY
MORE ridiculous words skewing the average toward a higher number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still don't quite grasp it? Okay, let's look at some examples. I have,
in front of me, a copy of From Finland with Love by Roman Schatz. It is
written in both Finnish and English and is a lovely bit of writing, a
fact which is entirely beside the point. In the opening sentence of the
Finnish version of the book, is the word "Lukukokemuksesi". It's
pronounced exactly as it looks. Seven syllables. It means "your reading
experience" in English. Luku- is a root word (or something close to it.
My knowledge isn't exactly top-notch here) that just means "chapter" by
itself. When combined with other words, it means "something to do with
reading". Kokemuksesi means "your experience".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impromptu language lesson aside, I want everybody reading this to take a
moment to pronounce that word. Lukukokemuksesi. It helps if you break it
up. Luku. Koke. Muk. Sesi. Now say it all quickly as if it were, you
know, actually all one word. Tricky, huh? No? Okay, try this on for
size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Juonnettavakseni." This one's a little trickier. Remember that the
Scandinavian J works like an English Y. So in Finnish, "jo" is actually
pronounced "yo".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juo. Netta. Vak. Seni. You can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it? No you don't. Know why? You have to pronounce the double-t and
the double-n. It's like a tiny pause on the sounds, with an emphasis
afterward. JuonNEHtTAHvakseni. Double-letters in Finnish work very
differently from English. Instead of modifying the sound to something
completely different, they just lengthen it. Which...really makes more
sense, don't you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay, I've bored you all to death with 500 words of rambling about
how funny the language sounds, and how hard it is to pronounce. What's
my point? Simple! Being completely surrounded by a language that sounds
so different from your own is a profoundly strange experience.
Everything from the written language to the ambient buzz of conversation
around you changes completely.  And it changes your brain a little bit,
ever so slightly. I'll see a familiar words or phrase, and I'll
accidentally pronounce it with a Finnish accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was especially noticeable within the first few hours of returning. I
had gotten off the plane from Amsterdam about an hour ago, and was
eating in a California Pizza Kitchen somewhere near L.A. with Jake (Hi
Jake!) when my head started to swim a little. It was about lunchtime,
and as a result, the place was pretty crowded. But instead of just
tuning out the dull roar of conversation around me, my brain kept homing
in on bits and pieces of it. Because there were words it actually
&lt;em&gt;understood!&lt;/em&gt; It wasn't just meaningless static anymore, they were
sounds with &lt;em&gt;meaning!&lt;/em&gt; It was about the time I asked for the check, and
marveled at our server's lack of accent that I realized I was suffering
from a mild dose of culture shock. In my own country. Wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And next time I grab some spicy molcajete with my chips, I have to
remember that it's molca-HEH-tay. Not molca-YEH-tay. Damn j's.&lt;/p&gt;

minimal difficulty, too. My customs agent was distracted, and I guess I
didn't look suspicious. I could have lied my butt off on my declaration
form and gotten off scott-free as long as I had some daring master plan
to avoid the drug (and agriculture?) sniffing dog. I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do that
though because, really, why bother?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough about American stuff! That's not why you're here! You're here
to read about foreign stuff! And I will deliver!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shopping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about grocery-shoppin' in Finland. At it's heart, it's really
not a whole lot different than grocery shoppin' over here. It's all
about the details. For one, there don't seem to be any huge,
grocery-only chains. There's Prisma, for example, which is huge, but
closer to a Wal-Mart equivalent. And you've got thinks like the S-Market
which are grocery-stores only, but they tend to be smaller than your
average Albertsons or Ralphs or what-have-you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I noticed was the way they handle their produce
shopping. Instead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0616_804x1072.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0616_804x1072_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Pictured: Ridiculous  convenience."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of putting it in a bag, weighing it, and hoping the cashier's scale
matches what the little mechanical doohickey says, they just have a
scale right on the produce aisle. You put your veggies in a bag, plop it
on the scale, and press the number associated with that veggie, and out
pops a barcoded label with the price right on it. Stick on the label,
and off you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the rest of the differences lie in selection. For example, the
soda aisle is a bit more barren than it would be here. Fewer brands, and
fewer weird spinoffs of said brands. But the thing that weirded me out
the most about the soda was...well, take a look for yourself. I'm sure
you'll spot it right way if you've ever drunk Fanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0607_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0607_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Got me every time. Tasted fine  though!"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly colored soda wasn't the only difference. There were far fewer soda
brands/flavors. There was Fanta, Sprite (though Sprite Zero seemed to be
more popular for some reason.), 7-up, Coke, Pepsi, Jaffa (caffeinated
fruit sodas. Blood orange, grapefruit, etc flavored), Dr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0608_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0608_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Mmm."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper, Schweppes (a limonadi soda."Limonadi" appears to just refer to
any lemony/berry soda.) and Mountain Dew. No root beer! At all! I was
able to find some for 3 euros a bottle (and it wasn't a large bottle) in
a tiny natural foods store, but it was clearly a specialty item. There
were of course, assorted knock-off brands as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weirdest part about sodas like Coke, Pepsi and Mountain Dew? They
were caffeine-free! Energy drinks are regulated far more strictly in
Europe than they are here, and it'd seem that American Coke has enough
caffeine to fall under that classification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, I'll bet they tasted better. I never even thought to grab a
bottle while I was there. Should've. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finns love sausage. Really, Finns love meat in most forms, but sausage
seems to hold a special place in their hearts. Allow me to show you how
much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/pano.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/pano_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Saaaaaaauuuuuuuusaaaaaaaaage."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much. Nearly everything on that aisle is some variety of sausage.
Wieners, sliced sausage, lunchmeat-style sausage, classic traditional
sausage, smoked sausage, linked sausage, sausage bits...you name it, it
probably exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sausage isn't the only thing that Fins are fond of. They're big on
bread. Bread of every variety. You know how over here, our bread is
usually confined to a corner, or maybe one side of an aisle, and it's
mostly just slightly different varieties of sliced white-bread?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0615_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0615_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"It's like a bakery just wandered into this grocery  shop."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all kinds of bread up there. There's no such thing as "specialty"
bread. There's just lots of different bread. They're big on rye bread,
but not on pre-slicing it. A breadboard and breadknife are staples of
every Finnish residence. Most of them are in the form of a pull-out
cutting board cleverly disguised as a drawer in the kitchen counter. 
All are cut and gouged from many years of use. The typical Finnish
breakfast is meat on bread with some sort of spread (or butter), so you
can see why both sausage and bread are so popular. The cereal aisle? Not
that impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0609_1072x8041.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0609_1072x8041_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Chips. Lots of 'em. that  impressive."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snacks! They're not a whole lot different than they are here. Take a
look to the right. Chips are a snacky food over there. The flavors and
labels are a little different, and the brands are, of course, different.
But other than that, they're very much the same. There's a lot more
potato chips, and fewer tortilla chips, and fewer weird flavors, but at
the end of the day, it's pretty much the same thing you'd find here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another minor difference is the way in which groceries get carried
around. You'll only find the push-carts in bigger stores. And even those
are different! All four wheels are articulated, so if you were so
inclined, you could turn your cart sideways and push it. I enjoyed this
&lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much. Otherwise, you've got two options: the basic handbasket,
or a handbasket mounted on a suitcase-style pair of wheels with a handle
reaching up to your hand. Once you've got all your food piled into&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0617_1072x8041.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0617_1072x8041_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"It  gets sort of awkward if a fourth person comes along and the other three  are still  bagging."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;your basket of choice, you lug it or wheel it up to the checkstand,
offload it all onto the conveyor belt, the cashier rings you up...and
then things get weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't bag your groceries for you. Furthermore, you're expected to
either provide you own bag, or fit everything into one or two durable
plastic bags that you'll find under the checkstand. To accommodate this,
latter half the stand is divided by one or two sliding dividers, as you
can see to the left. Those two black bars extending from the end of the
table can swing back and forth and slide along a track to make room for
more people's groceries. The little spindle of small plastic bags is in
case you don't need a full-on bag from the front of the checkstand. And
when I say big plastic bags, I'm not talking about a larger version of
our tiny, flimsy grocery bags. Think of the big plastic bags you get
from stores in the mall. Those are grocery bags over there. And you're
expected to reuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why the difference? It's greener for one thing, and for another
thing, for half of the year, you often find yourself heading home in
weather like this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0619_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0619_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;""Yeah, we've had a little snow recently. You can barely even  tell.""&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...either on foot or on a bike. And let me tell you, biking in snow with
a heavy bag of groceries on the handlebars trying to skew your bike to
one side is not an easy task! The tires keep wanting to slide sideways,
pedaling through the fluffy stuff is hard work, and it's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, everyone. Thus concludes my month-long sojourn
to (almost) the other side of the world. I hope you enjoyed reading it
even half as much as I enjoyed experiencing it. There's so much more
that happened that I didn't have the time or memory to retell in this
blog, so if you run into me, by all means, feel free to ask me about it.
I'll talk your ear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a final thanks to my girlfriend Kaisa for hosting me, translating
for me, and answering my endless questions about culture, words, and
pronunciation. Love you!&lt;/p&gt;

You get about five hours of dim light once a day, and the temperature
rarely, if ever climbs above zero degrees (32F). What's a Finn to do? 
Why, create all manner of lights fixtures and sculptures of course. I
just came back from Helsinki, and there's a citywide art exhibit going
on called "Lux". Predictably, all the of the exhibits involve light
somehow. I only saw two, and of those two, only got a good shot of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="750" height="510" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/738RWjIZfXs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This big ol' thing lit up the entire square in front of Tuomiokirkko
(Helsinki Cathedral) and if it's not clear in the video, actually had
musical accompaniment.
&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0535_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0535_1072x804.jpg?w=300" title="100_0535_1072x804"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just the beginning. I've already posted about the light
blocks in Jyväskylä that masquerade as innocuous bricks by day, and
reveal their illumination by night. You can see them to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sort of thing is a good example of the random sprinklings of light
fixtures you'll find everywhere. The highway leading out of Helsinki
has, in the dirt in the center divider, two long rows of sticks topped
by blue and purple lights. It's not uncommon to see a bridge lit up in
odd colors, or a pass along the highway illuminated just for the sake of
looking pretty. It's subtle, and if it hadn't been pointed out, I
probably wouldn't have noticed it, but Finns love their lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, though, I should be clear--Finland isn't a neon
paradise the way that, say, Vegas is. It's all very understated; Finns
don't appear to be big fans of direct lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0573_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0573_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Indirect  streetlighting."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This even carries over into indoor lights. Every light fixture is
shaded, dimmed, redirected, or otherwise.  Take a look to the left, and
you'll see an example of this on the promenade in the city center of
Jyväskylä.  This also carries over to Christmas lights. A lot of people
put them up, but I haven't seen anything to the degree of excess I
regularly see back home. So...no overwrought displays of extreme
Christmasosity, but a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of understated prettiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other news&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have I been up to these past few days? I'm glad you (may have)
asked! I've spent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0587_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0587_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Helsinki in the evening, tram and  all"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the last several days in Helsinki, seeing the sights, braving the
parking garages and visiting winter carnivals. I'm sure I've mentioned
public transportation in the past. Helsinki's is some of the best I've
seen (though, granted, not a difficult task). You can buy a Helsinki
Card that's good for up to 3 days. It allows you unrestricted travel on
all public transport anywhere in Helsinki. It's a little card with some
kind of tiny chip buried inside. Hold it up to a reader and it'll beep
and on you go. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0589_804x1072.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0589_804x1072_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Me  wearing the Princess of Winter's tiara. She offered. I  accepted."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Helsinki, we took the opportunity to visit an aquarium as well
as a kid's winter carnival. The two of us were much too old for the
carnival, but we ended up having a lot of fun anyway, and all of the
actors in costume seemed to enjoy our participation. At least, they
pretended to. We assisted a yeti in reading a phone book, went down a
slide in inner tubes for...some reason, I got spun around in a cart
attached by a length of wood to a rotating column, made cotton candy,
and (almost) learned to juggle. There was a backstory behind the whole
thing--it was a sort of scavenger hunt where the goal was to fill up a
little card with stamps--something about a mammoth sneezing and needing
lots of adventurers to go hunt down ice pearls or something. You know,
your basic fetch quest.  It &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; kind of make me wish that things like
that existed for people our age though...that'd be a lot of fun, you
know? Or maybe I'm too young for my age. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this from a resort/hotel thing in Mikkeli, and tomorrow I'm
going to wake up early and learn how to cross-country ski. Wish me luck,
and as few bruised tailbones as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, here's some pictures of Helsinki's central train/subway/bus
station.&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0597_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0597_1072x804.jpg?w=150" title="100_0597_1072x804"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0598_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_0598_1072x804.jpg?w=150" title="100_0598_1072x804"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finland"></category><category term="Foreign"></category><category term="Images"></category><category term="International"></category><category term="Photos"></category><category term="Snow"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>Pictures Aplenty</title><link href="http://pingzing.github.io/pictures-aplenty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-04T19:28:00+02:00</published><updated>2012-01-04T19:28:00+02:00</updated><author><name>travelneil</name></author><id>tag:pingzing.github.io,2012-01-04:/pictures-aplenty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In lieu of actually writing anything tonight, I've decided to treat you

&lt;h6&gt;"New Year's in  Jyväskylä"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 2012 from the future, everybody! I am currently sitting on the
couch about 5 hours before midnight, but this post is automatically
scheduled to post itself at 12AM on January first, Finnish time. So by
the time you read this, I will have likely done some, or possibly all of
the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eaten salad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eaten cocktail weenies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eaten tiny carellian pies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played board games with Kaisa and friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wandered into the 23F-or-so degree weather and watched the fireworks
    over the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imbibed a number of interestingly-flavored and festively-colored
    ciders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...so as you can tell, the New Year here isn't actually a whole lot
different than the New Year elsewhere. It'll just be a lot colder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception to the norm is a particular tradition that I may or may
not be observing (It depends on whether or not we can find some tin). In
it, revelers take a piece of horseshoe-shaped tin, melt it over the
stove (or fire, I suppose) and drop gooey mass of liquid metal into a
bucket of cold water. After it cools, you pull the twisted mass of metal
out of the bucket and attempt to tell your future by interpreting the
interesting shape the former horseshoe has been twisted into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Other News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been chilly all day. Despite the sun actually coming out today,
it's weak, early-morning level shine wasn't enough to melt last night's
snowfall in the slightest. Personally, I'm perfectly okay with this,
because I haven't seen nearly enough snow for this latitude to be
satisfied. Apparently, this time last year most of Finland was covered
in about half a meter of snow. But as the Finnish saying goes, "Years
are not brothers". (You can thank Kaisa's father Reima for that one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had lunch at a local Tex-Mex place called Amarillo that was really more
"General American food" than anything else. It did a pretty admirable
job of mimicking the "forgettable southwestern American food restaurant"
vibe, right down to the cheesy playlist. Their salsa was almost
indistinguishable from their ketchup though, which was a darned shame.
Kaisa assures me it was spicy, but I'm not certain I buy that. It would
appear the Finnish palate is a bit more spiciness-averse than the
average southern Californian's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. I'm aware this post is sadly pictureless, but I
intend to remedy that within the next few days. I've got a whole bunch
of pictures sitting on my camera I've been meaning to upload for a
while. Hopefully I'll be able to bombard you all with pictures soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, happy new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\~EDIT\~ It is now 1:19 AM and 2012 over here. Kaisa and I biked into
the city to see the fireworks. We were in a hurry to avoid missing the
end, and so it ended up feeling a lot like what I imagine biking through
a war zone is like. Streets somewhat deserted, people yelling from all
sides punctuated by flashes in the cloudy sky, booming noises and a
sense of urgency. But since there was no threat of injury or death it
was actually just a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture up top is a shot from across the harbor about 20 minutes
after the first set of fireworks ended. Apparently it's tradition for

&lt;h6&gt;"Even  more delicious than it  looks."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about moose-the-animal for a moment before we look into
moose-the-food. Moose are apparently incredible plentiful here in
Finland, to the point where they're more of a pest than a novelty.
They're such dangerous nuisances on the road, that the reflectors along
the sides of the roads are actually referred to as “moose mirrors”.
There's even a moose hunting season!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it's hardly surprising that someone, somewhere in the past
found a way to turn all that meat into food. And good thing too—it makes
for an excellent stew! Part of the Christmas dinner cooked by Kaisa's
mother, Airi, it was cooked with pork. Moose-and-pork(or
moose-and-chicken) stew is apparently a very traditional dish, and I can
certainly see why. The moose itself is sort of tough and savory, and the
pork or chicken works well to balance it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rice Porridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/riceporr.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/riceporr_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Pure, expansive  deliciousness."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas (Eve) breakfast. A hot, goopy concoction served with butter
and cinnamon sugar. Delicious and unbelievably filling I was served
about two ladles full, and was barely able to eat about two thirds of
it. Afterward? I felt my belly and I had a gut. I had to unbutton the
top button of my jeans! &lt;em&gt;Me!&lt;/em&gt; Hearty, filling and a little ridiculous.
Just the thing after a long morning of moose-hunting in minus two
degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/carellian.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/carellian_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Kinda funny shaped,  huh?"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carellian Pies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rye bread cut into ovals and filled with rice porridge, or possibly
carrots. Then the edges are folded up and rippled, and the entire
concoction is baked. I'm not personally a fan, but I also haven't had
one fresh from the oven. I imagine it'd make a great snack on a cold
winter day. Really, I could probably say that about most things I
mention in this post. When your entire country is shrouded in snow and
darkness for a quarter of a year, it's no surprise that you'd come up
with warm, hearty food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A whole bunch of other stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major Finnish staple appear to consist mostly of hard, dry bread—er, I
mean rye bread—covered with butter or cream cheese and garnished with
some sort of lunch meat and/or sausage. This sort of meal appears to
stand in for breakfast, a quick lunch, a snack, and sometimes even
dinner in a pinch, if you throw in some fruit or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/glogi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/glogi_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"A  glass of this will put you right to  sleep."&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very popular Christmas drink, glögi, is a form of mulled wine. It's
prepared with either fruits or red wine, and then has added Christmasy
spices. At a guess, I'd say cinnamon or something similar, but I'm no
culinary expert. It's usually served with raisins and gingerbread
cookies. It is, like many other things on this list, served hot. It's
also very delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's just the beginning. I've encountered a whole lot more, but I
need to leave myself some material for later, so I'll have to come back
to this another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I imagine that most of you guys have been reading for a little
while now, and probably have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; kind of questions. So if you've got
something you'd like to know or want me to make a post about, go ahead
and leave a comment and I'll address it in the next post. I'll disable
moderation for this post, so everybody should be able to leave a comment

&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas morning, everybody. It's noon right now, and I woke up
about half an hour ago. I looked out the window, and this is what I
saw.  Gotta say, I'm a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;"High noon in central  Finland"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas morning, everybody. It's noon right now, and I woke up
about half an hour ago. I looked out the window, and this is what I
saw.  Gotta say, I'm a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a quick anecdote: yesterday, I was introduced to a proper Finnish
sauna. Yes, Kaisa's family has one in the house. Pretty cool, right? The
sauna itself has a somewhat large antechamber which is essentially a
giant shower room. The doors leading into it are made of wood, and
opened with handles. This is because any other material would get way
too hot. Another door from the shower leads into the sauna proper. The
sauna is a windowless room with wooden walls, and a two-tiered wooden
bench to one side. The only source of light comes from the wood-burning
furnace in the corner, atop which rests a small pile of rocks. A wooden
bucket with a long-handled ladle sits on the steps, and is used to throw
water on the rocks to create steam. Eucalyptus oil can be added to the
water to create a somewhat overpowering, but very pleasant scent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice I've avoided all mention of the heat. That's because it
deserves a paragraph of it's own. The others had already used the sauna
before us and had, according to Kaisa, put a little bit too much wood on
afterward. As a result, it was a boiling 80 degrees Celsius (176 degrees
F).  I wasn't able to take it for long. Kaisa informed me that it's
usually supposed to only be 60-70 (140-160F) degrees, which actually
sounds like it'd be a lot more pleasant. It was also very dry, because
we only threw on a tiny bit of water, to keep it from baking us into
crispy critters. Ultimately, I found that the most pleasant part of that
sauna trip was taking a break and cooling off in the shower room. I
think I'll try it again some other time, but with a sane temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, as a final note, here's a picture of the sun. This is midday
light, people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyvää joulua! That is, Merry Christmas! I've been enjoying the
hospitality of the Hirvonens for the past day and a half and right now I
am so stuffed, I'm having a hard time budging from the couch. In fact,
I've just been informed that dessert is being served soon. I doubt I'll
be able to stuff more than a token amount of food into my
already-overfed self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...yep. Managed a bite of cake and a single cookie. I doubt I'll be able
to move for the rest of the night. Tomorrow's Christmas day, and it
promises to be a slow one. Because, interestingly, Christmas in Finland
works a little bit differently than back home. In fact, a lot of things
are a little different, and so, in the interest of sticking to my
appropriately kitschy title, I'll be going through a few things that are
just a little different on this side of this ol' globe of ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0506_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0506_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Nearby the tree  store"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the thematically appropriate topic. Joulu, aka
Christmas! (It helps if you realize that in the Scandinavian languages,
a "j" makes the "y" sound. Joulu = yule. More or less.) It's very subtly
different, and is basically about timing. Most of the festivities take
place on Christmas Eve! Most people actually get their trees on or just
before Christmas Eve. If they live in the countryside, and own a lot
with trees on it, or have a friend who does, they'll go out and cut down
their own. Apparently tree theft is a big deal, because when we were
walking through the Hirvonen forest, Tiina, Kaisa's sister, told me to
keep an eye out for footprints, because that'd probably mean that
somebody had been stealing their trees. Tiina, Kaisa and I walked,
Rauno, their younger brother, drove their tractor. We went as far as we
could, but then the tractor was blocked by a tree that had partially
fallen into the road. From there on, we walked, and went a-tree huntin'.
We wandered around for a while, pointing out and dismissing the
occasional tree. I finally spotted a good one a bit away from the road,
and we sawed it down, tied it to the tractor and drove it home. Rauno
and I dragged it into the sauna to dry for a while, and a few hours
later, it was decorated in the living room, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0498_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0498_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;"Christmas dinner in  progress"&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decorating the tree, we distributed and opened presents. As the
guest, I was given the task of handing out presents to people. I think I
did an admirable job of successfully pronouncing the battery of Finnish
names--Kaisa, Rauno, Tiina, Reima, Airi, Marjatta--with all their funny
double letters and rolled
r's.&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0512.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0512.jpg?w=300" title="100_0512"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we all ate far, far too much food. The ham was good, the moose was
better. Finally, most families will hold onto the tree for the next
several weeks, well into January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, most families make it a tradition to go out to the cemetery on
Christmas Eve and light candles at the base of the family plot. You can
see a picture of that to the right. A little blurry, but you get the
idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Driving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get the obvious thing out of the way. Metric system. Meters.
Kilometers. Okay. Are we good? Good. Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European signage is, due to the wide variety of languages spoken on the
continent, both pictorial and fairly universal. I saw the same signs in
Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. Speed limits are just numbers in a
circle, yield signs are (oddly) identical to those in the U.S., minus
the "Yield" text, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major difference is largely one of style. Europeans,
apparently, don't like stopping. They also like curves. Let me put it
this way: the whole time I've been here, I've seen exactly two stop
signs. And I've been in major cities, countrysides, parking lots, you
name it. Two. Intersections are largely governed by yield signs, parking
lots are mostly unsigned, roundabouts take the place of four-way
intersections, etc. As a result, none of the turns are the nice,
gridlike straight lines I'm accustomed to. Everything curves, like an
on-ramp or a merging lane on a freeway, because that's what most things
are: extended merging lanes.  I drove most of the way from Jyväskylä to
Varkaus, and it was an exercise in subtle, but significant differences.
Also, apparently, fuel efficiency is measured in Fuel/Distance, rather
than Distance/Fuel. So, Liters per 100km, rather than Miles per Gallon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one last thing! This one is probably unique to Finland, or at least
northern countries with lots of large wildlife. There's a very
well-defined etiquette when it comes to using your headlight's brights.
During the night time you ALWAYS have them on unless: there's an
oncoming car within a certain range, you're too close to another in
front of you, or you're in a well-lit area. Not having your brights on
at night otherwise is actually enough to be worth a ticket. The reason
is that moose have a nasty habit of darting into the road and turning
unwary drivers into road pizza. So, driving was an exercise in
constantly flipping my brights on and off and on and off and on
and...you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miscellaneous Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambling machines. Everywhere! Convenience stores, train stations, gas
stations, airports, inside grocery stores, you name it. Video poker
appears to be a mainstay, but I'm willing to bet there are other sorts
as well. I haven't taken a close look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bathrooms! They're very very similar, but different in some really
subtle ways. The first: no bathtub! Just a shower stall. The second: the
whole bathroom is tiled, and fair game for water! Every slopes into a
central (or not) drain. Detachable nozzles are very common, and probably
way too much fun to use for someone my age. Toilets mostly flush with
buttons or a funny lever you have to lift and then drop. Finally, all
the piping is exposed, rather than neatly hidden a way like it is back
home. Which makes sense, given that all the freezing that goes on in the
winter is very liable to make a pipe burst, and a burst pipe inside a
wall is baaad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all the big things I've noticed. There are a whole bunch of other
little details I can't remember right now, but I'll see if I can't make
a list and just post that up some time later. Will need to keep
something to write with on me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, an image, very, very few of you will understand. If you don't
get the joke, that's okay. You weren't meant to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pingzing.github.io/images/100_0497_1072x804.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}images/100_0497_1072x804_thumbnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday afternoon, we wouldn't be able to board the ferry until about 3PM
at the earliest. So we decided to spend the time wandering around
Helsinki and just generally being tourists. In doing so, I got a lot of
opportunities to see how being a tourist in a northern European city was
different from being a tourist in a major U.S. city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The foot traffic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. Picture, if you will, a sidewalk off of any given street in L.A.
Probably a few people walking down it, right? Maybe a food vendor? Okay.
Now take that, subtract the food vendors, and multiply it by about five.
Then you have an idea of what Helsinki is like. According to Kaisa, only
about 15% of the people who live in Helsinki actuall&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0448.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Helsinki at about
6PM on a
Sunday" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0448.jpg?w=300" title="Helsinki Evening"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;y
own cars, and I can see why. Everything is awfully close together, and
the roads are small, windy and covered in pedestrians. You can see an
example of just how crowded the streets themselves are to the right (as
well as some very cool architecture). Not many pedestrians here, but
this is a side street several blocks away from anything in particular. 
I wish I had a good picture of a busy intersection to give you a sense
of scale, but none of the ones I took came out any good. We'll be headed
back to Helsinki later on, so maybe I'll get some good ones then, or
maybe in the next few days in Jyväskylä.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to my relief, virtually everybody I've run into speaks English.
There are varying degrees of fluency, but most people seem to be able to
converse in it. But while on the ferry to Stockholm, I realized just how
obnoxious it must be to live in an area where so many people speak so
many languages. Every single announcement over the ship's intercom, or
introduction to a show, or whatever has to be spoken in &lt;em&gt;four different
languages.&lt;/em&gt; Swedish, Finnish, English, Russian. So the poor announcers
have to repeat themselves three times in a different language each time.
Finland seems to be more consistent at least about this sort of thing.
When I was in Stockholm, there wasn't a lot going on in the way of
announcements, but only about half of the signs hand any English
whatsoever. Sometimes you'd get Swedish and Finnish, and sometimes just
Swedish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0473.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gamla Stan Side
Street" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0473.jpg?w=300" title="Gamla Stan Side Street"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it above, but now I'm actually going to talk about it. I'm
really really jealous of people who live here because they have
interesting-looking buildings. I mean, take a look at this. It's just a
random side street in Sweden's Gamla Stan (Old Town), and it's still
cooler than just about any given main street back home. And both
Stockholm and Helsinki (capitols of their respective countries, I might
note) have statues and monuments galore. This guy to our right, who I
have dubbed Saint Dudeonhorseingston is hanging out near the Swedish
royal palace, just outside the Opera House.
&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0482.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0482.jpg?w=300" title="Saint Dudeonhorseingston"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We
went in for a closer look, and it turned out that his name was actually
the much less exciting Gustav Adolf the Second. The plaque was in
Swedish, so I have no idea what his story was, but Wikipedia tells me he
founded the Swedish Empire, so I guess that warrants a statue.  The
whole area his statue dominates is named Gustav Adolfs torg (Gustav
Adolf's Square), which leads to me believe, apropos of absolutely
nothing, that the locals call it "Ol' Gusty's square". In Swedish, of
course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0496.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0496.jpg?w=174" title="tinyfridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;ize
and automation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in Europe is smaller. The cars, the streets, the trucks, the
homes, the appliances, you name it, it's probably crammed more
efficiently into a tiny space than anything back home. No jokes,
please.\
 Take the average apartment fridge, for example. You'll see to the left
the fridge in Kaisa's apartment. The can of Pringles next to it is
regular size (though apparently here, it's an XXL Pack. This is why
we're fat, America). It's only a little bit bigger than your average
minifridge. The same goes for the dishwasher, the oven, and even the
sink to some extent.\
 In addition to that, robots are everywhere. Not the awesome,
artificially intelligent kind, but the boring, everyday kind. Instead of
the cashier weighing your produce and pricing it for you at checkout,
you use a digital scale and tell it what item you're weighing, and it'll
print out a label. When you get on the train or subway, the majority of
people are going to be using a card and the reader. Want to rent a hotel
room for the night and never deal with a fellow human being? No problem.
Omena Hotels is completely automated. Book a room online, they'll
email/text you your room number and keycode. The keycode expires when
you're supposed to check out, and there's no front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since I know you're all dying to know, I've saved the most exciting
subject for last. Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh. Actually not that much to say about it. It's cold, but actually
warmer than northern Idaho in the winter so far. That's probably going
to change in January, but it's really not a whole lot colder than the
average Tehachapi winter right now. Though it is sort of neat the way
all the building designs are clearly meant to accommodate the weather.
Two sets of doors in every building, double-paned windows, gutters
everywhere, coat racks at every table or entry hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all I've got for now. The next few days, I'll be spending in
Jyväskylä, taking it easy after a few busy days of travel and
sightseeing. If you want to get a hold of me, email, facebook, text,
whatever. (Don't expect a response to texts, though.) In closing, here's
a picture of me in a silly hat.&lt;a href="http://travelneil.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0455.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Silly Hats

&lt;p&gt;So, my first thoughts upon (finally) getting off the plane and seeing
the Amsterdam airport: &lt;em&gt;Wow, this is a nice airport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts five minutes later? &lt;em&gt;This isn't an airport! It's a mall with
airplanes and security screening on the side!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American airports, get it together. Not only is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my first thoughts upon (finally) getting off the plane and seeing

airplanes and security screening on the side!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American airports, get it together. Not only is Schiphol way more
visually attractive than any US international airport I've ever been in,
it's also much, much better designed. I will grant that many
international US airports are old, and I'm fairly sure Schiphol is
relatively new. But still, we're slacking. C'mon now, the Netherlands
have (or would that be The Netherlands has?) it together! Even their
security checkpoints are better laid out, and we're supposed to be
security freaks! They have 5 elevated booths with glass to the side and
above, with narrow choke points between each booth that allow passengers
to continue. Way easier to defend than our silly checkpoints. Sheesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say about the flight itself. It was like any other long
flight, only longer. The fact that we traveled at an average (ground)
speed of about 600 mph was pretty cool, but that's fairly standard for
an airplane. Still, the idea of hurtling through the air in a
pressurized metal cigar at speeds nearing that of sound is a pretty cool
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thought: despite it's relative grandeur and glamor, I don't
think I would've wanted to fly internationally in the jet set days. They
didn't have TVs will multiple full-length movies, music albums and TV
episodes mounted in the back of every chair. For example: I was able to
watch a few episodes of How I Met Your Mother, How to Train Your Dragon,
and about half an hour of Source Code before I got frustrated with how
stupid the protagonist was and gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helsinki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't get a great look at Helsinki from above, because by the time
the plane began its descent, it was totally dark, and there was fog and
clouds everywhere. It was also snaining (That's snow + rain for those
who are unaware. It's a miserable combination because it's like rain
that sticks to you). I did not envy the pilots. They brought us down
just fine though, and about 30 minutes later, I was off the plane and
had my bag. Didn't even have to go through customs, which was a nice
surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to meet Kaisa's brother Rauno and her sister Tiina. We
ended up spending about an hour at Tiina's apartment because she was
celebrating her graduation from school. (Some sort of fancy vocational
school. Not really clear on the details) When I walked in, I greeted her
with a Hauska tavata!" ("Nice to meet you!") and she gave me the most
shocked, blank look for a good three seconds. I glanced at Kaisa and
asked "Did I say that wrong?" and Tiina quickly told me "No, no! I was
just surprised!" So, if she's any indication, all you have to do to make
a good first impression on a Finn is know a little bit of their
language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long series of uninteresting decisions, Kaisa, her friend Emilia
and I hopped on a train. For Kaisa and I, to get to the hotel, and for
Emilia to meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. The original plan
was that we would join them, but as I was sitting on the train, I
realized that I was pretty much out of gas. The original plan wasn't
going to fly, so we instead opted to go the hotel and call it a night.
Exhausted though I was, the chance to walk through Helsinki at 6PM was
actually pretty cool. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of cool old architecture and a lot of foot
traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. Won't have much chance to update this thing for the
next few days, because I'll be on an overnight cruise to Stockholm and
back! I imagine that if there's any Wi-Fi available, it'll cost two arms
and half a leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. More pictures to come soon. Didn't get a chance to take any last
night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finland"></category><category term="Foreign"></category><category term="Images"></category><category term="International"></category><category term="Photos"></category><category term="Snow"></category><category term="Travel"></category></entry><entry><title>And We're Live</title><link href="http://pingzing.github.io/and-were-live.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-16T17:35:00+02:00</published><updated>2011-12-16T17:35:00+02:00</updated><author><name>travelneil</name></author><id>tag:pingzing.github.io,2011-12-16:/and-were-live.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Test, test.

&lt;p&gt;Good. I'll be using this blog to keep a record of my trip overseas for
this Christmas.  I'll make an effort to update it semi-regularly
but...well, no promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, it's 9:30AM, and I woke up at 7:45. Not sure when the last
time I did that was. It's different, seeing the sun at that angle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think setting this thing up has killed enough time. I'm going
to finish up whatever packing I've forgotten to do, then head over to
Jake's house to drop off the truck and catch a ride to LAX. After that,
I guess I'll just have to wait and see if I can find Wi-Fi in the
Amsterdam airport.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
