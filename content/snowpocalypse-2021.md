So it's been a little snowy in Helsinki lately. A few days ago, a huge winter storm dropped about 1ft/30cm of snow on us over the course of about two days. Now, today, it dumped another 2in/5cm on us. Here are some pictures.

We also had two brief, glorious FREEZING days of sun!

My apartment building hires a little snow plow to keep our parking lot clean. This pile has only grown since I took this.

Gotta take advantage of what sun you can find, you know?

If you cast a dramatic shadow like this, you would've taken the shot too.

Pictured: thigh-deep snow. I stayed on the pathâ€“my pants were _not_ waterproof.

Taken in a park. It's pretty!

All that snow piled up against the wall is from the parking lot on the roof of the building. Presumably shovelled off by tiny snow plows.
