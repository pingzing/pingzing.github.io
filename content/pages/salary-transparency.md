Summary: A history of my salaries in tech.

## What's this?
This page lists the salary for every job I've ever had in tech. That includes raises within the same positions, promotions to new positions, and job changes.

This is strongly inspired by a combination of two things. 

First, a past employer's philosophy around internal salary information. The default was to ask every employee, upon joining, if they'd like their salary to be shared within the company, on a page in the internal wiki, viewable by anyone. Employees were encouraged to do this, and a culture of speaking honestly about salaries was the norm. I no longer work there, and do not know if that's still true, but I hope it is.

Second, [Xe Iaso's sharing of xer own salaries](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency). As Xe says on xer page, one of the ways of fighting pay discrimination is making hiding it impossible. I'm hoping that adding a little bit of knowledge to the pool can help everyone be better informed about how much they're worth.

## The data, and some caveats
I've pulled this data from a combination of emails, contracts and paychecks. It's as accurate as it can be, but it's not 100% perfect. It intentionally omits employer names.

For some of the positions, there are extra details to how I was compensated beyond a recurring, static salary. For those, there will be a clickable arrow in the Salary column. Click or tap on the cell to expand it for more information.

Here's the above data, graphed:

![Graph of my annual salaries, compared to days worked at each salary level.]({static}/images/salary-chart.png)

The salaries have been normalized to total annual values, but have not been converted between currencies. As such, the first two values are in USD, while the rest are in EUR.

"Total Days" is, as above, not the amount of days I performed my job, but the amount of days I stayed at a particular salary level.

(Note that for the current job, the one with the "50% billed", the "Normalized annual salary" value in the graph is an optimistic estimate that assumes a billed rate of 112€/hr--reasonable for the area--and 100% client work, i.e., no gaps where there was no work for me.)

## In closing
I'll try to keep this page updated whenever this information changes. 

If you're reading this, I'd also like to encourage you to share your own information. By sharing this information openly, we can reduce the stigma around discussing pay, and make it easier for everyone to get equitable compensation. Companies thrive on keeping this information secret, because it allows them to low-ball people more easily. It's also in their best interest to propagate the idea that talking about salaries is somehow distasteful. You can help change that by doing what I've done here.
