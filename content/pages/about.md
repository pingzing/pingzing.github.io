Summary: A brief summary of this site, and its author.

## This site
Begun as a thrown-together free WordPress blog in 2011 to have somewhere to post my experiences in travelling to Finland. It's now a catch-all personal site for me.

More generally speaking, the site is also my own reaction to the growing trend of [massive, bloated websites](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm), which is something [I am not alone](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) in being annoyed by. Architecturally, this website would be right at home in the 90sâ€“its little more than a collection of static HTML pages. You'll find no NPM packages or Webpack shenanigans here. The only exception to that is the comment system, which is a stitched-together abomination of a single Javascript file, a handful of serverless functions, and a cloud-hosted NoSQL database.  


## Me
I'm Neil McAlister, a software developer living in Helsinki, Finland. Born and raised in California, I moved to Finland in 2015, and have been here ever since. I program stuff for fun and, if the title of this blog didn't make it _abundantly_ clear, enjoy travelling.

You can also find me on GitHub as [PingZing](https://github.com/pingzing) or Twitter [@pingzingy](https://twitter.com/pingzingy).
