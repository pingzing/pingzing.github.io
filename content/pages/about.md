## This site
Begun as a thrown-together free WordPress blog in 2011 to have somewhere to post my experiences in travelling to Finland. It's now a catch-all personal site for me.

More generally speaking, the site is also my own reaction to the growing trend of [massive, bloated websites](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm), which is something [I am not alone](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) in being annoyed by. Architecturally, this website would be right at home in the 90s–it is little more than a collection of static HTML pages. You'll find no NPM packages, Webpack shenanigans, or user tracking silliness here. The only exception to that is the comment system, which is a [stitched-together abomination]({filename}../the-frankenstein-comment-system.md) of a single JavaScript file, a handful of serverless functions, and a cloud-hosted NoSQL database.  


## Me
I'm Neil McAlister, a software developer living in Helsinki, Finland. Born and raised in California, I moved to Finland in 2015, and have been here ever since. I program stuff for fun and, if the title of this blog didn't make it _abundantly_ clear, enjoy travelling.

You can also find me on GitHub as [PingZing](https://github.com/pingzing) or Twitter as [@pingzingy](https://twitter.com/pingzingy).

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <small>(but professionally, this time)</small>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div markdown="1" style="text-align:justify;">
I'm a skilled software developer with over 7 years of experience in both consulting and product development contexts. I strive to deliver quality work, and care about the craft of software development. I excel at Microsoft technologies and Windows development, and thrive in both the full stack and the cloud. I'm experienced with agile methodologies, and DevOps workflows.

I'm proficient in a number of programming languages. I'm most comfortable in **C#**, **Rust**, and **TypeScript**. I have a great deal of experience with Microsoft's modern XAML-based UI frameworks, including **WPF**, **UWP** and **Xamarin**. Other notable technologies I have experience with include **Azure**, **AWS**, **Entity Framework Core**, **MongoDB**, **Azure Service Fabric**, **ASP.NET Core**, **NestJS**, **NodeJS**, and **Angular** (with the usual smattering of **HTML** and **CSS**).

Outside work, I enjoy hacking on personal projects, reading, weird indie video games, and writing fiction. I'm comfortable with public speaking, and love travelling (at least when there's not a pandemic about).

  <h6 class="project-subheader">https://github.com/pingzing/trippit/</h6>
<p></p>

Trippit is a journey planner for the greater Helsinki metro area. It hooks into city-provided APIs, and is written as a UWP app. I attempted to follow best practices in MVVM architecture and overall design.

It was originally meant to be a phone-first app with desktop capabilities, but then Windows 10 Mobile went the way of the dodo. It's probably my most complete application, though it never found much success due to the abrupt death of its target platform.

  <h6 class="project-subheader">Creator</h6>
  <h6 class="project-subheader">https://github.com/pingzing/solenecyoa</h6>

Solene is a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game. This was a more recent project undertaken as a creative exercise, and an attempt to see if I could make a monorepo project using .NET from top to bottom. I'm happy to say that I was!

It's a full-stack .NET application. It uses Xamarin.Forms for the Android and UWP applications, Azure Functions as a serverless backend, and has a pure-UWP admin client. One big advantage of the shared stack was the ability to share data models, and even some business logic between all the components.

  <h6 class="project-subheader">Creator</h6>
  <h6 class="project-subheader">https://github.com/pingzing/scannit-core</h6>

Scannit is a Rust-based library for reading NFC-based travel cards used by Helsinki Regional Transport in the greater Helsinki area. 

It has a C-based FFI that any other language that can "speak C" is capable of interfacing with. It also has C# bindings in the form of [ScannitSharp](https://github.com/pingzing/ScannitSharp) (`https://github.com/pingzing/ScannitSharp`), and an unfinished Android app implemented in Xamarin Forms in the form of [Scannit](https://github.com/pingzing/Scannit) (`https://github.com/pingzing/Scannit`).
