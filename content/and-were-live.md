Test, test. Is this thing on?

Good. I'll be using this blog to keep a record of my trip overseas for
this Christmas.Â  I'll make an effort to update it semi-regularly
but...well, no promises.

Right now, it's 9:30AM, and I woke up at 7:45. Not sure when the last
time I did that was. It's different, seeing the sun at that angle!

Anyway, I think setting this thing up has killed enough time. I'm going
to finish up whatever packing I've forgotten to do, then head over to
Jake's house to drop off the truck and catch a ride to LAX. After that,
I guess I'll just have to wait and see if I can find Wi-Fi in the
Amsterdam airport.
