Summary: The blog is now hosted on Github Pages!

Just a quick preliminary post to make sure everything is in order. I've moved the blog from its old WordPress site to a new location on Github Pages. I'm actually writing posts locally in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"), which is WAY better than the old, slow WordPress web editor. As a fringe benefit, from being hosted on GitHub's pages,  don't even need to handle the web administration stuff. I can handle uploading new stuff with Git. Pretty snazzy!

All the old WordPress posts may be a little broken--Pelican's WordPress import was a little spotty, and I had to do some script magic to get the images working. One thing that's _definitely_ broken is WordPress's galleries. I'm not really sure how I'm going to unbreak them yet, so uh, just pretend nothing is wrong.
