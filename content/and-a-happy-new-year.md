######"New Year's in  Jyväskylä"

Happy 2012 from the future, everybody! I am currently sitting on the
couch about 5 hours before midnight, but this post is automatically
scheduled to post itself at 12AM on January first, Finnish time. So by
the time you read this, I will have likely done some, or possibly all of
the following:

-   Eaten salad
-   Eaten cocktail weenies
-   Eaten tiny carellian pies
-   Played board games with Kaisa and friends
-   Wandered into the 23F-or-so degree weather and watched the fireworks
    over the city
-   Imbibed a number of interestingly-flavored and festively-colored
    ciders

...so as you can tell, the New Year here isn't actually a whole lot
different than the New Year elsewhere. It'll just be a lot colder.

One exception to the norm is a particular tradition that I may or may
not be observing (It depends on whether or not we can find some tin). In
it, revelers take a piece of horseshoe-shaped tin, melt it over the
stove (or fire, I suppose) and drop gooey mass of liquid metal into a
bucket of cold water. After it cools, you pull the twisted mass of metal
out of the bucket and attempt to tell your future by interpreting the
interesting shape the former horseshoe has been twisted into.

*In Other News*

It's been chilly all day. Despite the sun actually coming out today,
it's weak, early-morning level shine wasn't enough to melt last night's
snowfall in the slightest. Personally, I'm perfectly okay with this,
because I haven't seen nearly enough snow for this latitude to be
satisfied. Apparently, this time last year most of Finland was covered
in about half a meter of snow. But as the Finnish saying goes, "Years
are not brothers". (You can thank Kaisa's father Reima for that one.)

Had lunch at a local Tex-Mex place called Amarillo that was really more
"General American food" than anything else. It did a pretty admirable
job of mimicking the "forgettable southwestern American food restaurant"
vibe, right down to the cheesy playlist. Their salsa was almost
indistinguishable from their ketchup though, which was a darned shame.
Kaisa assures me it was spicy, but I'm not certain I buy that. It would
appear the Finnish palate is a bit more spiciness-averse than the
average southern Californian's.

That's all for now. I'm aware this post is sadly pictureless, but I
intend to remedy that within the next few days. I've got a whole bunch
of pictures sitting on my camera I've been meaning to upload for a
while. Hopefully I'll be able to bombard you all with pictures soon.

Until then, happy new year!

\~EDIT\~ It is now 1:19 AM and 2012 over here. Kaisa and I biked into
the city to see the fireworks. We were in a hurry to avoid missing the
end, and so it ended up feeling a lot like what I imagine biking through
a war zone is like. Streets somewhat deserted, people yelling from all
sides punctuated by flashes in the cloudy sky, booming noises and a
sense of urgency. But since there was no threat of injury or death it
was actually just a lot of fun!

The picture up top is a shot from across the harbor about 20 minutes
after the first set of fireworks ended. Apparently it's tradition for
the city to fire off fireworks near the city center, and then from the
other side of the bay, amateur fireworks enthusiasts reply in turn in
less well-choreographed, but more enthusiastic bursts.
