######  The piikki

I don't really have any interesting Christmas-related observations this
year. Though I *did* just watch Kaisa's neighbor fillet some fish that
he'd caught this morning. Apparently, properly filleted fish costs about
20 euros per kilo at the store, and what he'd caught came out to 6 bags
with 410 grams each--just under 10 euros worth of fish per bag. It's
been salted, and one bag is currently sitting in the fridge waiting to
be prepared somehow. He also did it with a handmade knife, and an
interesting looking tool called a piikki (fish spike, or literally
"thorn") which apparently doubles as something you can jab into the ice
and pull yourself out with, should you fall in.

Anyway, with that little interlude out of the way, feel free to enjoy
some pretty pictures I took this morning, a little after 11AM. Pictures
are behind the "Continue reading..." link.
